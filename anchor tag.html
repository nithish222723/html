    <h1><u>MECH/ELECTRICAL/CIVIL CAD SOFTWARES</u></h1>
    <P>Computer-aided design (CAD) is a way to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of real-world products before they're ever manufactured. <br>With 3D CAD, you can share, review, simulate, and modify designs easily, opening doors to innovative and differentiated products that get to market fast. In 1985, Dr.</P>
    <h2><u>ELECTRICAL CAD</u></h2>
    <P>Electrical computer-aided design (ECAD) software systems are used to design and develop electronic systems such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs). <br> software enables electrical engineers to create and modify diagrams and layouts including 2D and 3D models.</P>

    <h3><u>MECHANICAL CAD</u></h3>
    <p>Mechanical CAD (MCAD), also referred to as mechanical design automation (MDA), software enables mechanical engineers to create product designs with accurate and detailed technical drawings (2D or 3D models), and specifications for engineering and manufacturing.
